# Project 01 - single-threaded response time measurement

[project01.py](./project01.py)


Have the LED blink at random intervals
measure average, minimum, maximum response time for 10 flashes total.

Use a JSON file to store the parameters for the experiment as in the prior exercises.

Write the response times to a JSON file along with min, max, average response time and "score" in number of misses vs. total light flashes.
